# Pet Recovery: Utilizing PHAST 1's SN code for Swift Reunions

WAGGURACY understands the distress of losing a beloved pet, and that's why we've introduced our Pet Retrieval Feature, designed to help you reunite with your furry friend as quickly as possible.


**How It Works:**

1. **SN code:** Each PHAST 1 is equipped with a SN code, boldly labeled with a unique SN code.

2. **Lost Pet:** If your pet ever goes missing, anyone who finds them can visit the iFinda.pet website printed on the PHAST 1.

3. **Contact Information:** After visiting iFinda.pet, the finder can enter their contact information and provide details about your pet’s current location. By entering the PHAST 1 SN code, they can quickly and efficiently send this information to you.

4. **Reunion:** With the contact information provided, you can directly reach out to the finder and coordinate the safe return of your pet.

**Benefits:**

- **Quick Retrieval:** Our Pet Retrieval Feature facilitates a swift and efficient process for reuniting lost pets with their owners.

- **Direct Communication:** The feature enables direct communication between the pet owner and the finder, streamlining the retrieval process.

- **Increased Success Rate:** With an easy and effective method for finding lost pets, the Pet Retrieval Feature significantly increases the likelihood of a successful reunion.

# Fences for Pet Safety
The Petority fence feature allows you to establish virtual boundaries for your pets, ensuring they stay within safe areas while roaming. This feature enables you to monitor and manage your pet's activity range, while also providing real-time alerts and notifications to keep you informed about their whereabouts and movements.

## Set up a Fence
Would you like to be alerted when your pet either leaves or enters a certain area, such as your home or a local park? If so, you can set up a Fence, which is a perimeter that defines a safe area for your pet to be in.

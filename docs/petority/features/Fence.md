# Fences for Pet Safety
The Petority fence feature allows you to establish virtual boundaries for your pets, ensuring they stay within safe areas while roaming. This feature enables you to monitor and manage your pet's activity range, while also providing real-time alerts and notifications to keep you informed about their whereabouts and movements.

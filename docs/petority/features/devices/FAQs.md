# FAQs
## Device pairing
### 1.What to do if pairing fails？
+ Please check if your phone's Bluetooth is turned on and if your phone has an active internet connection.
+ Ensure that the device has sufficient battery power.
+ If the device turns off during the binding process, please provide power to the device before continuing.
+ Keep the device as close as possible to your phone during the pairing process. 
### 2.What to do if the device cannot be scanned？
+ Please make sure the device is in a scannable state, and ensure that it has sufficient battery power.
+ Ensure that the Bluetooth and WiFi permissions on your phone are turned on.
## Network configuration
### 1.What if the router is a 5GHz network?
Most routers available in the market are dual-band routers, offering both 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi frequencies. To connect to the 2.4GHz network, select a network without the "5G" suffix.

+ If you haven't modified your WiFi name:**

    Check the WiFi list on your phone. Networks with names like "XXX-5G" indicate 5GHz WiFi, while networks without the "5G" suffix are 2.4GHz WiFi.

+ If you have modified your WiFi name:**

    Access your router's management page or use the router's companion app to view the SSID (network name). It will indicate whether it is 5GHz by displaying "5G" in the name.

    (Router manual - Router gateway IP address - Enter in your browser - Wireless settings - View the SSID, and the 5GHz network will have "5G" mentioned in the name).

    By connecting to the 2.4GHz network, you can ensure compatibility with most devices, as some older devices may not support 5GHz WiFi. 

### 2.What to do if it prompts 'Incorrect account or password'?
+ Please check if your wireless network name (SSID) and password contain any special characters. Avoid using Chinese characters or any other special symbols in both the network name and password. It is recommended to modify your password accordingly.

+ If your network has no password, you can leave the password field empty and simply click on "Connect" to start the connection process.

### 3.What to do if the network configuration fails?
#### Attempting to use your mobile hotspot to set up the device:

+ Check the password length for your mobile hotspot; it should not exceed 15 characters.

+ Ensure that your mobile hotspot has no restrictions on the number of connected devices. For iOS 12.0 and above on Apple devices, enable "Maximize Compatibility." For Android devices, set the "Maximum Connections" to a value greater than 1.

+ Avoid using special symbols in the password for the mobile hotspot.

+ Set your Android mobile hotspot to use the 2.4GHz frequency band.

**Note:** 

Choose a stable mobile network (mobile hotspot) for the setup to avoid issues with weak signal or low network speed that may prevent device connection.

**If the above steps are not effective, check the WiFi router settings:**

+ Verify that the router settings have not been modified (enable 2.4GHz WiFi frequency, do not hide WiFi or enable anti-spoofing features).

+ Make sure the WiFi is set to the 2.4GHz frequency band. Reconnect using the mobile hotspot to attempt the setup again.

+ Restart the router and try the setup again.

+ Please check if your home WiFi's SSID (network name) and password contain any Chinese characters or special symbols, and make sure there are no spaces while entering them. If there are any, you need to access your router's wireless settings page and change them to alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers). Also, ensure that the password does not exceed 15 characters.

+ If the above steps are not effective, please go back to the previous page and re-enter the WiFi configuration page to attempt the network setup again. Avoid trying to enter the password directly on the WiFi password input page.

### 4.How to optimize a weak network connection?
+ Check if the configured WiFi is connected to too many devices. If so, try restarting the router.

+ If none of the above steps work, attempt to reconfigure the WiFi settings. 
### 5.If the device's network connection is unstable and frequently disconnects, what can I do？
+ Restarting your router.
+ Try configuring a stable WiFi network for your device. 
### 6.If all the solutions have been tried and the device still cannot connect to the network successfully, what should I do?
If you have tried all the mentioned steps and are still facing issues, you can try contacting customer service representatives (available from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM) to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

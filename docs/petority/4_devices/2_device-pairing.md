    Start by downloading the WAGGURACY app from the Apple App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). Install the app on your smartphone.

2. Create or Log In to Your Account:

    + If you're a new user, [create a WAGGURACY account](/docs/petority/accounts/signing-up) using a valid email address and secure password.
    + If you already have an account, **log in** using your credentials.

3. Preparation:

    Please follow the in-app instructions to complete the following preparations:
    + **Press and hold** the side button of PHAST 1 to power it on. When the indicator light **flashes blue**, the device is ready for pairing.
    + **Open** your phone's **Bluetooth**.
    + Keep your phone **close to** the **PHAST 1**.

4. Access Device Pairing:

    After tapping the **Pair the PHAST 1** button. When the PHAST 1 pop-up appears in the app, it indicates that the device has been detected via Bluetooth. Tap **To Pair** to start the binding process.
    + Tip: If you have more than one PHAST 1, check that the name suffix in the app matches the code on the device.

5. eSIM Plan Details & Activation Policy: 
    
    + Please make sure to review the specific terms of your selected eSIM plan.
    + Billing for PHAST 1 begins upon first activation.

6. Set up [Home Fence](/docs/petority/features/Fence):

    Tap the **To set** button and select your home address on the map as the center point of the Home Fence. Once the location is confirmed, tap **OK** to save the settings and complete the configuration.

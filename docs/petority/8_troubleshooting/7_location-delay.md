# Resolving PHAST 1 Location Delay or Inaccuracy

If you are experiencing issues with delayed or inaccurate location information from your PHAST 1, consider the following solutions:

1. Check Network Connection:

	Ensure your device is **connected** to a stable internet connection. Unstable network connections can lead to delays in transmitting location information.

2. Enable Location Services:

	Confirm that location **services** on your device are **enabled**. On mobile devices, you can usually find this in the "Location" or "Location Services" settings.

3. Ensure Device is On:

	Confirm that the PHAST 1 is **powered on** to ensure proper functioning and transmission of location information.

4. Update WAGGURACY App:

	Make sure you are using the **latest** version of the WAGGURACY app. [Updating the application](/docs/petority/general-setting/update-app) can resolve some performance and stability-related issues.

5. Restart Devices:

	Try restarting both the PHAST 1 and the mobile device you are using. This can sometimes resolve temporary communication or location issues.

6. [Check Battery Level:](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-checking)

	Low battery levels may impact device performance. Ensure the PHAST 1 has **sufficient** battery charge.

Keep in mind that the performance of PHAST 1 may also be influenced by factors such as *environmental conditions*, *weather*, and *signal strength*. When using the PHAST 1, ensure it is in an area with **good signal coverage** to enhance location accuracy and timeliness.

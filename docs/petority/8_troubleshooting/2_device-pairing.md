# Device pairing failed
If you are experiencing difficulties with pairing your PHAST 1, consider the following solutions:

1. Check Device Compatibility:

	Ensure that your smartphone is compatible with the PHAST 1. Check the specifications and requirements to make sure it meets PHAST 1's support standards.

2. Verify Bluetooth Connection:

	Confirm that the **Bluetooth** feature on your smartphone is **enabled** and **set to discoverable**. Turn off and then turn on Bluetooth, then attempt to re-pair.

3. Ensure PHAST 1 is in Pairing Mode:

	Follow the instructions in the PHAST 1's user manual to ensure the device is in **pairing** mode. Typically, devices need to be in pairing mode to connect with others.

4. Try Restarting Devices:

	Sometimes, resolving temporary connection issues can be achieved by restarting both your smartphone and the PHAST 1.

5. Update Wagguracy Application:

	Ensure that you are using the **latest** version of the Wagguracy application. Check for [available updates](/docs/petority/general-setting/update-app) in the app store or on the official website.

6. [Check Battery Level:](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-checking)

	Ensure that the PHAST 1 is [charged](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-charging). Low battery levels may lead to connection problems.

If pairing fails:
 
+ Check if your phone's **Bluetooth** is turned on and has an active internet connection.
+ Ensure the device is charged.
+ If the device turns off during pairing, [**Charge the device**](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-charging) before continuing.
+ Keep the device **close** to your phone during pairing.

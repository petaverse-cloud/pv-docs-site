# What to Do If the Account Deletion Fails:
If you encounter issues with the failed deletion of your Petority account, you can take the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check Network Connection: 

	Ensure that your device is connected to the internet and has a stable network connection. Deleting an account may require communication with Petority servers.

2. Clear Cache and Cookies: 

	Clear the cache and cookies in your mobile app to ensure you have the latest information and status.

3. Try Different Browser or Device: 

	Sometimes, certain devices may have compatibility issues. Try using a different browser or device to perform the account deletion operation.

When deactivating your account, a security verification is required. The application will send a verification code to your registered email address to ensure security.

Once you submit the account deletion request, the account enters a **30-day** review period. During this time, it cannot be used, and clicking **Keep Account** will cancel the deactivation process.

**Account Recovery After Deletion:**

+ Once an account is successfully deactivated, it cannot be retrieved.
+ After submitting a request for account deactivation, it generally takes **30** days for the review process. During this period, you have the option to restore the account, canceling the deactivation request and regaining access. You can attempt account recovery on the login page.
+ After the review is completed and approved, the account will be deactivated successfully, and all data will be permanently deleted, making recovery impossible.

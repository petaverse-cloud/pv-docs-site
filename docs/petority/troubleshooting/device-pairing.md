# Device pairing failed
If you are experiencing difficulties with pairing your Petority device, consider the following solutions:

1. Check Device Compatibility:

	Ensure that your device is compatible with the Petority device. Check the specifications and requirements to make sure it meets Petority's support standards.

2. Verify Bluetooth Connection:

	Confirm that the **Bluetooth** feature on your device is **enabled** and **set to discoverable**. Turn off and then turn on Bluetooth, then attempt to re-pair.

3. Ensure Petority Device is in Pairing Mode:

	Follow the instructions in the Petority device's user manual to ensure the device is in **pairing** mode. Typically, devices need to be in pairing mode to connect with others.

4. Try Restarting Devices:

	Sometimes, resolving temporary connection issues can be achieved by restarting both your device and the Petority device.

5. Update Petority Application:

	Ensure that you are using the **latest** version of the Petority application. Check for [available updates](/docs/petority/general-setting/update-app) in the app store or on the official website.

6. [Check Battery Level:](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-checking)

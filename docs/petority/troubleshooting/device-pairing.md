If you are experiencing difficulties with pairing your Petority device, consider the following solutions:

3. Ensure Petority Device is in Pairing Mode:

	Follow the instructions in the Petority device's user manual to ensure the device is in **pairing** mode. Typically, devices need to be in pairing mode to connect with others.

4. Try Restarting Devices:

	Sometimes, resolving temporary connection issues can be achieved by restarting both your device and the Petority device.

5. Update Petority Application:

# Account Creation Failed
If you encounter issues while trying to register for a Petority account, this guide provides possible solutions to help you resolve the problem and successfully create your account.
+ When creating an account using an email, please select an email address that has not been registered with the Petority App before.
+ If you find that the email address you are trying to use has already been registered with another account, please try using a different email address for registration or go through the password reset process if you believe you have an existing account.
+ Ensure that the username and password you enter meet the requirements, such as length, character types, etc. Double-check for any input errors or omissions.
+ When using third-party login for the Petority App, you will need to authorize the third-party provider to access your account information.

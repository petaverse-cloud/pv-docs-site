# Account Creation Failed
If you encounter issues while trying to register for a Petority account, this guide provides possible solutions to help you resolve the problem and successfully create your account.

1. When creating an account using an email, please select an email address that has not been registered with the Petority App before.
2. If you find that the email address you are trying to use has already been registered with another account, please try using a different email address for registration or go through the password reset process if you believe you have an existing account.
3. Ensure that the username and password you enter meet the requirements, such as length, character types, etc. Double-check for any input errors or omissions.
4. When using third-party login for the Petority App, you will need to authorize the third-party provider to access your account information.

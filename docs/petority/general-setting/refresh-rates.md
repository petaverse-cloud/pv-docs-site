## Available Refresh Rate Options:
Petority provides four refresh rate options for updating pet location and health data:

+ **10 Seconds:** 

	For users who require real-time updates and want to monitor their pet's location and health with minimal delay. Please note that this option may consume device battery more quickly due to frequent updates.

+ **30 Seconds:** 

	A balanced option that offers updates every half-minute, suitable for most users' needs. It strikes a good balance between real-time monitoring and battery conservation.

+ **60 Seconds:** 

	Designed for users who prioritize device battery life over very frequent updates. This option updates the data once every minute.

+ **90 Seconds:** 

	Offers longer intervals between updates, suitable for users who want to maximize device battery life and don't require very frequent data updates.

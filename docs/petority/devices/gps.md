**GPS Initialization Required for First-time Device Usage**

When using the device for the first time, GPS initialization is necessary. This step ensures the device can successfully acquire GPS signals and accurately determine your location.

**Partial Map Functionality Affected Without GPS Initialization**

Failure to complete GPS initialization may impact certain functionalities of the map. Map features typically rely on GPS signals to determine location information. Without initialization, the device may not accurately acquire location information, limiting map functionality.

**Important Tips:**

1. GPS Initialization Should Be Done Outdoors

	To ensure successful GPS initialization, perform the process in a wide outdoor space. Buildings, large structures, trees, and other objects may obstruct GPS signal reception. Therefore, outdoor spaces provide a better chance of obtaining stable GPS signals.

2. GPS Initialization Required After Complete Power Loss

	If your device experiences a complete power loss and is restarted, GPS initialization is required again. Even if you've previously initialized the device, power loss may result in the loss of GPS information, necessitating reinitialization to ensure proper device functionality.

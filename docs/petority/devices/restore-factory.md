Petority devices occasionally require a factory reset to restore them to their original settings.

Follow the steps below to perform a factory reset on your Petority device:

**Step 1:** Open the Petority App

Launch the Petority app on your smartphone. Log in to your account.

**Step 2:** Access Device Settings

Tap **User** > **Device** > **Setting**

**Step 3:** Choose Factory Reset

Tap **Factory Reset**

**Step 4:** Confirm the Action

Confirm your intention to proceed with the factory reset.

After the factory reset is completed, you'll need to reconfigure the device from scratch. This include **pairing** it with the app, **connecting to Wi-Fi**, and other initial setup steps.

**Note:**
+ Make sure **Bluetooth** is **turned on** and your phone is **connected** to a **2.4GHz** WiFi.
+ Charge the Docker using the provided **USB** cable, **Align the magnets** to **attach** the Tag and Docker.
+ Keep your phone as **close** to the device as possible.
+ Keep in mind that performing a factory reset will **erase** all data and settings on your Petority device, essentially returning it to its **original** state as if it were brand new. Only perform a factory reset when necessary, and be aware of the consequences.

# Location Delay or Inaccuracy

If you are experiencing issues with delayed or inaccurate location information from your Petority device, consider the following solutions:

1. Check Network Connection:

	Ensure your device is connected to a stable internet connection. Unstable network connections can lead to delays in transmitting location information.

2. Enable Location Services:

	Confirm that location services on your device are enabled. On mobile devices, you can usually find this in the "**Location**" or "**Location Services**" settings.

3. Ensure Device is On:

	Confirm that the Petority device is powered on to ensure proper functioning and transmission of location information.

4. Update Petority App:

	Make sure you are using the **latest version** of the Petority app. Updating the application can resolve some performance and stability-related issues.

5. Restart Devices:

	Try restarting both the Petority device and the mobile device you are using. This can sometimes resolve temporary communication or location issues.

6. Check Battery Level:

	Low battery levels may impact device performance. Ensure the Petority device has **sufficient** battery charge.

Keep in mind that the performance of Petority devices may also be influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, weather, and signal strength. When using the Petority device, ensure it is in an area with **good signal coverage** to enhance location accuracy and timeliness.

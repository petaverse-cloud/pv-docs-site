# Petority Geofence Event Notifications
Petority's geofence feature allows you to create virtual boundaries for your pet's safety and to receive notifications when your pet enters or exits these predefined areas. Geofence event notifications help you stay informed about your pet's location and movements, ensuring their safety and well-being.

Before receiving geofence event notifications, you'll need to [set up geofences](/docs/petority/features/fence) in the Petority app.

**Receiving Geofence Event Notifications:**

Once you've created geofences, you'll automatically start receiving geofence event notifications when your pet enters or exits these predefined areas. These notifications will help you stay updated on your pet's location and movements. Here's what you can expect:

+ Enter Geofence Notification: You'll receive a notification when your pet enters a geofenced area.

+ Exit Geofence Notification: You'll be notified when your pet exits a geofenced area.

**Ending Fence Event Alerts:**

Managing Geofence Event Notifications, see [Notification Settings](/docs/petority/general-setting/notification)

Geofence event notifications are a valuable feature that helps you ensure your pet's safety and monitor their whereabouts, especially in areas where they should be supervised or restricted. By setting up and managing geofences effectively, you can have peace of mind and a greater sense of control over your pet's outdoor activities.

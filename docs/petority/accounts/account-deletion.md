## FAQs
### What to Do If the Account Deletion Fails:
+ When deactivating your account, a security verification is required. The application will send a verification code to your registered email address to ensure security.
+ Once you submit the account deletion request, the account enters a 30-day review period. During this time, it cannot be used, and clicking **Keep Account** will cancel the deactivation process.

### Account Recovery After Deletion:
+ Once an account is successfully deactivated, it cannot be retrieved.
+ After submitting a request for account deactivation, it generally takes 30 days for the review process. During this period, you have the option to restore the account, canceling the deactivation request and regaining access. You can attempt account recovery on the login page.
+ After the review is completed and approved, the account will be deactivated successfully, and all data will be permanently deleted, making recovery impossible.

### Not Receiving the Verification Code?
+ Check your junk/spam inbox for the verification email.
+ Ensure that **noreplay@peteverse.cloud** is on your email's approved sender list. If not, add it to your whitelist.

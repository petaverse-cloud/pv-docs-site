# Petority Account and Device Binding
Petority devices follow unique binding rules to ensure account **security** and device **uniqueness**. Here are the relevant provisions regarding device binding:

+ One Device, One Account: 

	Each Petority device can **only** be bound to **one account**. This means users **cannot** simultaneously bind the same device to multiple accounts.

+ Unbinding Process: 

	If a user needs to unbind a device from the current account, they must complete the **[unbinding](/docs/petority/devices/unbinging)** process provided by the Petority app. After unbinding, the device can be bound to another account.

+ Security Considerations: 

	The formulation of device binding rules takes into account the security of user accounts. By restricting device binding to one account, we can better ensure the effective protection of user device information and data.

# Device Activation
To activate your Petority Docker & Tag, the Tag must sit ontop of your Petority Docker and have access to electricity. Charge the Docker using the provided USB cable, and align the magnets to attach the Tag and Docker. See: [Charging Docker & Tag](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-charging)

 Here's how to reactivate your Petority device:
1. Fully [charge your device](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-charging) (the light on the Petority device should turn **green** after about **2** hours).
2. [Log into](/docs/petority/accounts/signing-up) your Petority account using the email address.
3. Select the safe place you are currently located and where you will be connecting to WiFi
4. You will need **Blueetooth** turned on on your phone, which is how we *find* your Petority device when it is on the charger and plugged in.
5. Tap on Connect to WiFi. *Select* your **WiFi** network and *enter* the **password**. Your Petority device will then connect to your selected WiFi network.
6. When [pairing your Petority device to a new pet](/docs/petority/devices/device-pairing), you will be prompted to fill out your pet's personal details
7. Wait for the notification that your device has been activated, and you're ready to beign using the Petority device!

# Device Activate
To **activate** your Petority Docker & Tag, the Tag must sit in the indention on the top side of your Petority Docker and access to electricity. See: [Charging Docker & Tag](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-charging)

Here's how to reactivate your tracker:
1. Fully charge your device (the light on the Petority device should turn green after about 2 hours).
2. Log into your Petority account using the email address.
3. Select the Safe Place that you are currently located at and where you will be connecting to WiFi.
4. You will need to have Bluetooth turned on on your phone, which is how we find your Petority device when it is on the charger and plugged in.
5. Tap on Connect to WiFi. Select your WiFi network and enter the password. Your Petority device will then connect to your selected WiFi network.
6. If attaching the Petority to a new pet, you will be prompted to fill out the personal details for that pet.
7. Waitting for the notification that the device is fully activated, and you're ready to begin using the Petority device!

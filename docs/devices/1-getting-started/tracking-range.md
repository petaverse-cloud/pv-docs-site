# How Far Can It Track My Dog?

**With a Petority, as long as your dog is in the United States, there is GPS and cellular (LTE) coverage, there is no limit on how far Petority can track your pet!**

Petority offers a reliable tracking solution to help you keep tabs on your furry friend, but the tracking range can vary based on factors like network coverage and terrain. Here's what you need to know about the tracking range of Petority:

+ GPS and Network Coverage:

    Petority relies on GPS technology and network coverage to provide accurate location information. As long as your pet is within an area with network connectivity, you can track their location. This means that in urban and well-connected areas, the tracking range can be quite extensive.

+ Open Spaces vs. Obstacles:
  
    In open outdoor spaces, such as parks or fields, you can expect a broader tracking range. However, when your pet is indoors or in areas with obstacles like buildings or dense vegetation, the tracking range might be limited due to potential signal interference.

+ Real-time Updates:
  
    Petority provides real-time updates on your pet's location. This means you can monitor their movements continuously, regardless of the distance, as long as they are within an area with network coverage.

+ Keep in Mind:
  
    It's important to note that while Petority offers a considerable tracking range, the actual distance can be influenced by the factors mentioned above. Always ensure that your pet's collar or tag has a clear line of sight to the sky to receive optimal GPS signals.

**Petority is designed to help you track your dog's location effectively, providing you with peace of mind whether your pet is nearby or exploring a bit farther from home.**

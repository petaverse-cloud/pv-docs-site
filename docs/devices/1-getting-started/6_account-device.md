# Wagguracy Account and Device Binding
Wagguracy devices follow unique binding rules to ensure account security. Here are the relevant provisions regarding device binding:

+ One Device, One Account: 

	Each Wagguracy device can **only** be bound to **one account**. This means users **cannot** simultaneously bind the same device to multiple accounts.

+ Unbinding Process: 

	If a user needs to unbind a device from the current account, they must complete the **[unbinding](/docs/petority/devices/unbinding)** process provided by the Wagguracy app. After unbinding, the device can then be bound to another account.

+ Security Considerations: 

	The formulation of device-binding rules considers the security of user accounts. By restricting device binding to one account, we can better protect user information and data effectively.

# What to do if you have a Petority device?
If you have a Petority device, there are a few steps you can take to get started and make the most out of its features:

+ Download the App:

    First, download the Petority app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android) and install it on your smartphone.

+ Create an Account:

    Open the app and [create a Petority account](/docs/petority/accounts/signing-up). This will allow you to access and manage your device's data and settings.

+ Pair the Device:

    Follow the instructions in the app to **[pair your Petority device](/docs/petority/devices/device-pairing)** with your account. 

+ Charge the Device:

    If your device needs [charging](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-charging), **use the provided charger and cable** to ensure that your device has sufficient power for tracking.

+ Configure Settings:

    Inside the app, you can configure various settings for your device including **[setting up fences](/docs/petority/features/fence#set-up-a-fence)**, adjusting [notification](/docs/petority/notification/enable-nitif) preferences, and customizing activity [tracking](/docs/petority/general-setting/refresh-rates).


+ Monitor Location and Health:

    Once your device is paired and set up, you can use the app to [monitor your pet's location](/docs/petority/features/live-tracking) and [health data](/docs/petority/features/health-monitoring). You'll be able to see where your pet has been and monitor their heart rate and activity levels. 

+ Set Up Notifications

    Customize the [notification settings](/docs/petority/general-setting/notification) to receive [alerts](/docs/petority/notification/type) when your pet leaves a designate area (fence) or if there are any changes in their health.

+ Explore Features:

    Take some time to explore the app's features. You can track your pet's [real-time location](/docs/petority/features/live-tracking), view [historical data](/docs/petority/features/health-monitoring), and even [set up personalized routines](/docs/petority/features/fence#set-up-a-fence).

+ Keep It Updated:

    Keep your Petority app and [device updated](/docs/petority/devices/upgrade-firmware) to access the latest features and improvements.

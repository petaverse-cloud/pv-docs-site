# What to Do If You Have a Petority Device

If you have a Petority device, there are a few steps you can take to get started and make the most out of its features:

+ Download the App:

    First, download the Petority app from the [App Store (iOS)](/img/logo.svg) or [Google Play Store (Android)](/img/logo.svg) and install it on your smartphone.

+ Create an Account:

    Open the app and [create a Petority account](/docs/petority/accounts/signing-up). This will allow you to access and manage your device's data and settings.

+ Pair the Device:

    Follow the instructions provided in the app to **[pair your Petority device](/docs/petority/features/devices/Device%20Pairing)** with your account. 

+ Charge the Device:

    If your device needs charging, make sure to do so **[using the provided charger and cable](/docs/devices/battery-charging/battery-charging)**. This will ensure that your device has sufficient power for tracking.

+ Configure Settings:

    Inside the app, you can configure various settings for your device. This might include **[setting up geofences](/docs/petority/features/devices/Fence#set-up-a-fence)**, adjusting [notification preferences](/docs/petority/features/General%20Settings#1-notification-settings), and customizing activity tracking.

+ Monitor Location and Health:

    Once your device is paired and set up, you can use the app to [monitor your pet's location](/docs/petority/features/live-tracking) and [health data](/docs/petority/features/health-monitoring). You'll be able to see where your pet has been and keep an eye on their heart rate and activity levels.

+ Set Up Notifications

    Customize the [notification settings](/docs/petority/features/General%20Settings#1-notification-settings) to receive [alerts](/docs/petority/features/alerts-notifications) when your pet leaves a designated area (geofence), or if there are any changes in their health metrics.

+ Explore Features:

    Take some time to explore the app's features. You can track your pet's real-time location, view historical data, and even set up personalized routines.

+ Keep It Updated:

    Make sure to keep your Petority app and [device firmware updated](/docs/petority/features/devices/upgrade-firmware) to access the latest features and improvements.

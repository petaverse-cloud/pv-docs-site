# Charging Your Petority Device

To charge your Petority Tag, you'll need a Petority Docker and access to electricity.

The Petority device takes **3** hours to charge from 0 to 100%. We'll send a reminder at **10%** to recharge. 

+ Any standard USB **type C** to micro USB cable works with the Petority Charging Base.
+ Make sure your Petority Docker is plugged in. Place the Petority Tag on the Petority Docker.

When you place your Petority Tag on the Petority Docker, the light on the base will turn **blue**, indicating your tag is docked. 

Youâ€™ll notice the LED light on the Petority Docker will also turn on. If your Petority Tag pulses **blue**, this shows the Petority Tag is charging.

When fully charged, the **blue** LED light will stop pulsing on your Petority Tag. 

To charge or activate your tag, the module must sit in the indention on the top side of your Petority Docker.

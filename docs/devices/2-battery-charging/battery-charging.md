# Charging Docker and Tag
To charge or activate your tag, the Tag must sit in the indention on the top side of your Petority Docker and access to electricity.

The Petority device takes **3** hours to charge from 0 to 100%. We'll send a reminder at **10%** to recharge. See: Alerts & Notifications]

## Charging the Tag:

+ Place the Tag on the top shell of the Docker:

	Gently place the Tag into the corresponding slot on the Docker, ensuring proper alignment and secure placement.
+ Connect the Docker to a Power Source:

	Use the USB-C charging cable provided in the product packaging to connect the Docker to a power adapter or USB port on a computer.

+ Charging Indicator Light:

	The Docker is equipped with an LED indicator light that displays the charging status. An orange light indicates that the Tag is charging, while a green light indicates that the Docker's battery is fully charged.

+ Wait for Charging Completion:

	Once the Tag is fully charged, the indicator light will stop blinking and remain green.

# Battery Charging
To charge or activate your Tag, the Tag must sit in the indention on the top side of your Petority Base and have access to electricity.

The Petority device takes **3** hours to charge from **0** to **100**%. We'll send a reminder at 10% to recharge your device. See: [Alerts & Notifications](/docs/petority/notification/type)

## Charging the Tag:

+ Align the magnets to attach the Tag and Base:

	Gently place the Tag into the corresponding slot on the Base, ensuring proper alignment and secure placement.
+ Connect the Base to a Power Source:

	Use the **USB-C** charging cable provided in the [product packaging](/docs/devices/general-information/kit) to connect the Base to a computer's USB port or power adapter.

+ Charging Indicator Light:

	The Base is equipped with an [LED indicator light](/docs/devices/light-sound/light-color) that displays the charging status. A **gradient light** indicates that the Tag is charging, while a **green light** means that the Base's battery is **fully** charged.

+ Wait for Charging to Finish:

	Once the Tag is fully charged, the indicator light will stop blinking and remain green.

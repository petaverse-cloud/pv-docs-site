# Battery Charging
To charge or activate your Tag, the Tag must sit in the indention on the top side of your Petority Base and have access to electricity.

**Device Charging Time：**

The Petority device takes approximately **3** hours and **15** minutes to charge. Users simply need to connect the device to a power source and wait for the charging process to complete. Once fully charged, the device will reach 100% battery level.

**Battery Level Alert Functionality：**

Low Battery Alerts: When the device battery level drops below ten percent or is about to shut down, the Petority device automatically sends low battery alert notifications.

To assist users in managing device battery levels effectively, the Petority device also provides charging reminder functionality. See: [Alerts & Notifications](/docs/petority/notification/type)

Users can [set reminders to be sent when the battery level drops below ten percent](/docs/petority/general-setting/notification), ensuring timely charging to maintain normal device operation.

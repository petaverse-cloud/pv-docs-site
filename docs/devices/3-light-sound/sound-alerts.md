# Sound Alerts and Automatic Recall

**Sound Alerts:**

Petority devices trigger an **[Automatic Recall](/docs/petority/devices/light-sound)** function. This function is pre-configured to guide the pet back within the safety confines of the designated area.

When a pet ventures outside the predefined safe zone, Petority devices emit a distinct sound alert pattern to signal the occurrence.

The integration of sound alerts and automatic recall functions in Petority devices provides timely warnings and measures when a pet leaves the safe zone. This comprehensive approach helps ensure the pet's safety, offering owners peace of mind as they effectively manage and care for their cherished companions.

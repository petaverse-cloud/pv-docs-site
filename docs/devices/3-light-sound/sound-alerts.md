# Sound Alerts and Autoplay Ringtones
**Sound Alerts:**

When a pet ventures outside the predefined safe zone, Petority devices trigger the **[Autoplay ringtone](/docs/petority/devices/light-sound)** function. This function is pre-configured to guide the pet back within the safety of the designated area.

Integrating sound alerts and Autoplay ringtone functions in Petority devices provides timely warnings and measures when a pet leaves the safe zone. This comprehensive approach helps ensure the pet's safety, offering owners peace of mind as they effectively manage and care for their cherished companions.

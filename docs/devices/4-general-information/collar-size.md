# How to Choose the Right Collar:

1. **Measure Neck Circumference**: Use a soft measuring tape or string to measure your dog's neck circumference. Ensure the measurement is snug but not too tight, leaving a bit of room for comfort.

2. **Refer to Recommended Size Range**: Based on the measured neck circumference, refer to the recommended size range in the table above. Choose the size that best fits within your dog's measurement.

3. **Consider Breed and Body Type**: Different breeds and body types may require different collar sizes. Larger breeds typically require larger sizes, while smaller breeds may need smaller sizes.

4. **Ensure Comfort and Safety**: Select a collar made from soft and comfortable materials, and ensure that the buckle and adjustment mechanism are secure to prevent accidental loosening or damage.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your dog's collar fits properly, providing both comfort and security during walks and everyday wear.

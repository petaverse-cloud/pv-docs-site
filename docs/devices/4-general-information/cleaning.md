# Petority Device & Collar Cleaning Guide
## Collar Cleaning:
1. Sink Cleaning:

Use warm water and a cleaning agent to clean the strap. Place the strap in a mesh bag and wash it in warm water with a gentle detergent to ensure thorough cleaning.

2. Air Drying:

Allow the strap to air dry in a well-ventilated area to ensure complete dryness before your pet wears it again

Petority Device Cleaning:
While the Petority Tag is waterproof, it is not suitable for machine washing. Please use alternative cleaning methods:

1. Magic Eraser Cleaning:

For slight wear or marks, it is recommended to gently wipe the Tag with a magic eraser. Avoid using alcohol to clean the module to prevent damage.

2. Tag Rinse:

+ Use a damp cloth with mild soap or a pet-safe disinfectant.
+ Gently wipe the surface of the Tag.
+ Avoid submerging the Tag in water.
+ Dry thoroughly before reattaching to your pet.
3. Base Rinse:
+ Use a soft, dry cloth to clean the Base.
+ Avoid using liquids or submerging the Base in water.
+ Ensure the Base is powered off during cleaning.
+ Wipe gently to prevent damage to electronic components.

### Precautions:
+ When cleaning Petority devices, ensure that the device is turned off and disconnected from the power source.
+ Avoid using alcohol or other chemical cleaning agents to prevent damage to the device and strap.
+ When cleaning the module, avoid forcefully disassembling or using strong water pressure to prevent impacting device performance.
+ Ensure all components are completely dry before reassembly.
+ Establish a regular cleaning routine, especially if the device is often exposed to dust or humid environments.
+ Avoid using strong chemical cleaners to prevent damage to the device's surface or waterproof seals.

These simple yet effective cleaning methods and precautions will help ensure the cleanliness and optimal condition of both Petority devices and straps.

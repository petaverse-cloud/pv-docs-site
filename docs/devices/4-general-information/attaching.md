**Step 1:** Preparation

Before wearing your Petority Device, ensure that you have received the complete package, including the Petority Tag and collar.

To insert the Tag, slide it upwards into the collar frame with a curved edge. Please note that attempting to insert it from the top (downwards) is not possible and is strictly prohibited.


**Step 3:** Adjusting the Size

Thread the band that's provided in the package through both sides of the band frame. Then pass it through the buckle on the band to adjust the size of the TAG on your pet's neck.

**Step 4:** QR Plate

Attach the QR Plate to the band as a safety measure in case your furry friends get a little too adventurous. 

**Step 5:** Check for Secure Attachment

Check if the Petority Tag is securely attached to the collar, ensuring that the Tag won't easily come off. Gently tug on the Tag to confirm that it stays securely in the desired position.

**Step 6:** Activate Petority

Following the Petority product instructions, [activate the Device](/docs/devices/getting-started/device-activate) and ensure all relevant information is correctly input. This way, it will be easier to locate your pet if it goes missing.


**Important Tips:**

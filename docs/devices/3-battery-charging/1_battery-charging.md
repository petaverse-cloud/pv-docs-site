**Battery Level Alert Functionality:**

Low Battery Alerts: When the device battery level drops below ten percent or is about to shut down, the PHAST 1 automatically sends low battery alert notifications.

To assist users in managing device battery levels effectively, the PHAST 1 also provides charging reminder functionality. See: [Alerts & Notifications](/docs/petority/notification/type)

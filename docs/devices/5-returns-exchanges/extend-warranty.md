At Petority, we strive to provide our customers with the highest quality products and exceptional customer service. As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, we offer an Extended Hardware Warranty Policy to provide additional protection and peace of mind for your Petority hardware products.

**Coverage Period:**

The Petority Extended Hardware Warranty extends the coverage beyond the standard limited warranty period, offering additional protection for a designated extended period of time. This extended coverage begins after the initial **Six months** warranty period provided with the purchase of your product.

**Purchase Option:**

The Extended Hardware Warranty can be purchased separately from the product and must be acquired within a specified time frame following the original purchase date. This option allows customers to enhance their protection and extend the warranty coverage for their Petority hardware products.

**Enhanced Protection:**

With the Extended Hardware Warranty, customers can continue to enjoy coverage for material and manufacturing defects, providing added peace of mind during the extended period. This enhanced protection ensures that your Petority hardware products remain safeguarded against unforeseen issues beyond the standard warranty period.

**Terms and Conditions:**

The terms and conditions of the Extended Hardware Warranty, including coverage period, exclusions, and claims process, are outlined in the warranty documentation provided at the time of purchase. Customers are encouraged to review the warranty terms carefully to understand the coverage scope and conditions.

**Customer Support:**

For inquiries or assistance regarding the Extended Hardware Warranty, customers can contact Petority Customer Support at help@petority.com for guidance and support. Our dedicated support team is available to address any questions or concerns related to the extended warranty coverage.

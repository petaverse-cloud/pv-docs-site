# Limited Warranty Policy

**Six-Month** Limited Warranty.

## Warranty Period:

The warranty period is **six months** from the retail purchase date or, for online orders, from the confirmed delivery date as documented by postal delivery confirmation.

## Covered Products:

Petority Base, Petority Tag

## Remedies Under This Limited Warranty:

If a covered product develops a defect and Petority receives a valid claim during the warranty period, Petority will, at its sole discretion and within the limits permitted by law, either:

1. Repair the defective covered product at no cost using new or refurbished replacement parts, or
2. Replace the defective warranty product with a new or refurbished warranty product or an equivalent product.

If Petority determines that replacing the defective covered product is unreasonable, Petority may refund the purchase price paid for the covered product. These are your sole remedies within the limits permitted by law. You may be responsible for shipping and handling costs for the covered product for repair or replacement, unless prohibited by applicable law. Any replacement of defective warranty products or parts under this limited warranty will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period of the returned warranty product or any additional period that may apply in your jurisdiction.

## How to Obtain Warranty Service?

- To obtain warranty service, fill out the warranty service form. You must first obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA), which you can request from our support team at help@petority.net. In your request, include the serial number of the warranty product, a brief description of the reason for your return, photos of the damage or defect (where visible), and a description of the steps you have taken to address the issue. Proof of purchase details may also be required to obtain an RMA.

- Upon receipt of an RMA, deliver the defective warranty product (using its original packaging or equivalent protective packaging) along with proof of purchase indicating the purchase date to the address specified by Petority. By sending the covered product, you confirm that upon Petority's receipt of the defective covered product, ownership of the covered product transfers to us. If Petority determines that the claim is reasonable under this limited warranty, Petority will bear the cost of shipping the repaired or replacement warranty product to you. Any warranty product returned to Petority without a valid warranty claim or RMA may be refused, returned at your expense (prepaid), or disposed of at Petority's sole discretion, with no further liability or obligation to you.

## Exclusions and Limitations:

1. **Product Identification Restrictions:**

	This limited warranty applies only to products manufactured by Petority or bearing the Petority trademark, trade name, or logo. It does not cover any Petority products and services beyond the covered product.

2. **Exclusion of Parts and Software:**

	The warranty does not apply to consumable parts (such as batteries) or software associated with the covered product, even if provided with the covered product. The applicable license agreements covering such software govern your rights to use it.

3. **Usage Restrictions:**

- The warranty does not apply to damages caused by:
- Use with non-Petority products.
- Accidents, abuse, misuse, food or liquid spills, or other external causes.
- Operation outside of the permitted or intended uses described in the product specifications and user manual.
- Failure to follow instructions for the use of the product or using incorrect voltage or power source.
- Services provided by non-Petority representatives.
- Cosmetic damage, such as scratches or dents, unless there is ordinary wear and tear on the product's casing or paint requiring replacement of defective components.

## National Statutory Rights:

Consumer rights under national legislation governing consumer goods sales may not be affected by this warranty. Disputes will be subject to the current dispute resolution procedures in Petority's Terms of Service.
